     * Damage = Str * Weapon Power * Handicap
	 * Where Handicap is the superiority of the weapon type. You can use helper function computeMultiplier to get the value.
	 * You will implement a loop. Loop will decrease the health points of the opponent by the amount of their dmg
	 * Ex:
	 * Fighter1 dmg = 50, hp = 500. Fighter2 dmg = 25, hp = 700;
	 * after 1st turn
	 * Figther1 hp = 500-25 = 475, Fighter2 hp = 700 - 50 = 650
	 * after 2nd turn
	 * Figther1 hp = 475-25 = 450, Fighter2 hp = 650 - 50 = 600, continiue until one of the fighters drop below 0 or turns >10
	 * 
	 * There are three outcomes of a fight 
	 * 1) The fighter wins, at the end of the turns his hp is > 0, and opponent has hp <= 0
	 * 2) The fighter loses, at the end of the turns his hp <= 0, and opponent has hp > 0
	 * 3) The fight is draw, either both fighters hp <= 0, or fight lasts longer than 5 turns.
	 *
	 * The winner fighter earns money equal to the amount of reward variable. Loser loses the half of the reward.
	 * If the loser does not have any more money the user will be asked to either execute the fighter, or give him another chance and let him live.
