/// A image class, containing a rectangular table of pixels.
///
/// ----- Pixels -----
/// Pixel is the basic component of a image, represents a tiny square cell filled by a color.
///
/// Learn more about pixel: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pixel
///
/// ----- Width and height -----
/// A image is a rectangle. The width and height of this rectangle represent the number of columns and rows of the grid.
/// Its also called resolution, usually quoted as "width Ã— height", e.g. "1920 x 1080".
///
/// ----- Order of pixels -----
/// In our image class, pixels they are stored row by row, from top to bottom
/// then from left to right in each row.
/// So the pixel at i's row, j's column is pixels[i * width + j]
///
/// For example, in a 3x3 image looks like
/// A, B, C
/// D, E, F
/// G, H, I
///
/// then the elements of pixels are [A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I]
/// the pixels A is pixels[0*3 + 0], or pixels[0]
/// the pixels H is pixels[2*3 + 1], or pixels[7]
///
/// ----- Pixel and color -----
/// There are many representations of color, for example,
/// - Black and white photo: we only need a non-negative value to represent the brightness,
///   see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_and_white,
///   Its type is Image<float>, the range of the float is [0, 1] (0 = black, 1 = white, others are gray of different brightness)
///
/// - A colorful RGB image: a mixture of 3 colors, Red, Green and Blue, with different intensities.
///   See http://www.rapidtables.com/web/color/RGB_Color.htm
///   A common 24-bit RGB color uses three 8-bit non-negative integers in [0, 1, 2 ... 255] (0,0,0 = black, 255,255,255 = white)
///   define as class RGB { int r, g, b  };
///   The the image type is Image<RGB>
///
/// - Pixel made by characters: we use it to draw ASCII art in console, such as:
