/// Substitute an individual frame at some position with another frame, this is useful for editing the scene in video
/// it is similar to array[x] = y;

// TODO: implement the substitute function, go to Video.h to find its declaration
// Please check if position is out of range of the video
// e.g. call substitute(10, someImage) on a video of 5 frames
// (You can also check if the width and height of this frame match the width and height of the video
//  e.g. use a 1920 x 1080 frame in 1280 Ã— 720 video. But it is not required in this assignment)
//
// For simplicity, if the input is illegal, just skip and do nothing
